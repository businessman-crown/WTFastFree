# WTFastFree
WTFast is a GPN (Gamers Private Network) that optimizes your internet connection for online games. It reduces lag, packet loss, and jitter by routing your gaming traffic through faster, more stable paths. Unlike traditional VPNs, WTFast focuses only on game data, helping to improve performance without slowing down other internet activities.
